### Version Control System (keep reading and this will make sense towards the end).
Let’s say you have a project you want to work on. 

Now you have two primary motives:
- To write some code
- To take up the project as a team, meaning that more than one people are going to be responsible for writing the code.

So suppose you write a "Hello World!" program and then your friend/other developer decides that it should say "Hello, I am awesome" instead of the original "Hello World!".
Even for this little piece of code, you will have a copy on your PC and your friend will have one on his PC.
Let’s say you change the code; now at this point your friend wouldn't know the changes you have made and vice versa.

This is where the **Git** magic comes.
- Git lets you save your code online.
- Git will allow all the developers of a project to see what changes the other one has made.
- It allows you to discuss issues in your code with other developers.

And a lot more...

**I think now you have a decent idea of what Git is.**
