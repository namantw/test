If you forked someoneâ€™s repository (forked, explained under terminology, scroll up) then follow these instructions
[Fork A Repo - Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and then the commands below.

If you are the upstream yourself, (i.e. you are the guy who created the original repository) then follow the instructions below
- **$ git clone <add the repository address here along with .git at the end>**
(clones/copies everything from that repository to your local machine)
- **$ git add filename.extension**
(this adds the file you want to change on the server)
- **$ git commit**
(this commits your changes to the repository with an explanation message)
- **$ git push origin master**
(this finally sends all your changes to the server. This is the final step of changing the code on your repository on the server)
  
  **You just started using GitHub. Congratulations :D**
